        <p>Dear Affiliates & Entrepreneurs,</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">
          What is worse than wasting your time and energy chasing a prospect that
          cannot buy a N25k digital product?
        </h2>

        <p>It's probably when they ghost you, post you or call you a scam!</p>

        <p>Some even go as far as wishing to bite off your head.</p>

        <p>
          It's sad you are trying to make their life better, and
          they turn to call you names.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, as long as you keep doing your best, a few nut heads
          will always come out to crush your spirit.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know this is not new to you anymore.
        </p>

        <p>You've seen it too many times and are used to it by now.</p>

        <h2>
          But, what if there&rsquo;s a more rewarding and satisfying way of
          deploying your expertise to make more money compared to what made a
          nut head call you a scam?
        </h2>

        <p>What if you could deploy your skills to go after the big bucks?</p>

        <p>What if Drop Servicing is your next big game?</p>

        <p>Just to be clear, Drop Servicing is Different from Drop Shipping.</p>

        <p>
          I know you must have heard of Drop Shipping, but they are two
          different business models.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Drop Servicing involves selling Digital Services to Businesses and
          Entrepreneurs who have pressing needs and money.
        </h2>

        <p>
          And then you get someone else to deliver a quality job at a lower price.
        </p>

        <p>You act as a middle man to arbitrage the transaction.</p>

        <p>That is, you make profit by making everything possible.</p>

        <img src="./drop-safe/drop servicing done-for-you.png" alt=""  width="100%" >

        <p></p>
        <img src="./drop-safe/testimonials/8.png" alt="" width="100%">

        <p>
          This business model I'm revealing to you is not new, it has been there
          for ages.
        </p>

        <h2>This is what Digital Agencies do:</h2>

        <p>
          They charge huge amounts to deliver a digital service such as Web or
          Graphics design and outsource the labour for less.
        </p>

        <p>The profit margin is always madd.</p>

        <p>
          So if that&rsquo;s the case, why is Drop Servicing coming out now?
        </p>

        <p>Here's the reason why you may be hearing about it now:</p>

        <p>
          All the articles and Youtube tutorials you will find out there only
          leave you with an explainer video.
        </p>

        <p>
          An explainer that talks about how profitable Drop Servicing is as a
          business.
        </p>

        <p>Which is actually true.</p>

        <p>
          Yet, those videos have left thousands of interested viewers with many
          questions:
        </p>

        <img src="./img/DSComments.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />

        <p>
          I was among the thousands with unanswered questions, and I
          needed answers real quick.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was no complete manual to follow to successfully deploy the
          business.
        </p>

        <p>So, I started searching for answers.</p>

        <p>And after combing every damn resource out there,</p>

        <h2>Here's my number #1 discovery:</h2>

        <p>
          Setting up a successful drop servicing business is
          too technical for the average Joe.
        </p>

        <p>And it costs some money to get it running.</p>

        <p>There are a few people who know about Drop Servicing; they want it, but they don't know how to deploy it successfully.</p>

        <p>Apart from that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You need to understand the most profitable and in-demand services
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to know how to create an enticing offer that clients cannot
            resist
          </li>
          <li>
            You need to know how to position yourself as an Authority with the ability to
            deliver quality service to your niche
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I was blown away by what I discovered.</p>

        <p>The tutorials I saw on YouTube barely even scratched the surface.</p>

        <p>I became a total believer in Drop Servicing.</p>

        <p>
          I had to document every single thing I learned and share it with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          My aim was to remove the barrier to entry so that you can
          kickstart your Drop Servicing business without stress.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, combining my in-depth research together my training as a professional
          Software Developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to map out a blueprint that you can copy and paste to
          kick start your Drop Servicing business.
        </p>

        <h2>
          I made sure the sestup was dead simple and costs you $0 to get started
          from A-Z.

        <p>I don't want to brag:</p>

          But, Drop Servicing for Affiliates & Entreprenuers (DROP SAFE) is one of the most complete and comprehensive guides
          you can get out there.
        </p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s a sneak peek of what you will learn.</p>

        <p>
          First, let's do a cost analysis of these skills if you're getting them
          outside:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Cost of learning how to build a website from scratch is 150k+
          </li>

          <li>
            The Cost of learning Drop Servicing from scratch 250+
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's over 750k+</p>

        <p>
          If you aim to learn from the best of the best, that's really how much
          it's going to cost you.
        </p>

        <p>

          how to build a simple landing page, write your business plan, and
          finally learn the ins and outs of Drop Servicing to get started.

          your business?

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Is Drop Servicing Legal/Ethical?</h3>
        <p>
          Drop servicing is an entirely legal business model. If you take both
          your clients and your service providers seriously, you shouldn’t have
          any problems regarding law requirements and legal issues. You should
          always be aware of what is happening, why you’re doing it that way,
          and who you are working with. In this case, if you are knowledgeable
          about every step of the journey, you will not have to question the
          legality of what you are doing.
        </p>

        <h3>Is Drop Servicing Profitable</h3>
        <p>
          Drop servicing can be a very profitable business model these days.
          Low-entry requirements and the possibility to start with zero budget
          make it accessible and promising. Your client pays you upfront, and
          you decide how much of that sum you want to allocate to your service
          provider. Depending on the particular niche, type of work, and
          deadline, you make a profit in any case. While drop servicing
          definitely cannot be called a “money-making factory,” when done right,
          it will bring you the desired results.
        </p>

        <h3>Where do I find Services Providers</h3>
        <p>
          Generally, service providers are abundant in various freelance
          aggregators. The most popular ones include:
          <ul>
            <li>Fiverr Upwork</li>
            <li>Freelancer.com</li>
            <li>People per Hour</li>
            <li>HubStaff Talent</li>
            <li>And many more!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What Services Can I Start Serving?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Social media management</li>
          <li>Virtual assistant services</li>
          <li>Video creation</li>
          <li>Guest posting</li>
          <li>Ad copywriting</li>
          <li>Video editing</li>

          <li>Graphic design</li>
          <li>User testing</li>
          <li>Search engine optimization</li>
          <li>Link building</li>
          <li>Voiceover</li>
          <li>Résumé writing</li>
          <li>Lead generation or nurturing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What skills do I need to start Drop Servicing?</h3>
        <p>
          To get started, all you need is basic marketing and sales skills.
          Otherwise, it would be complicated to promote your business, find the
          first clients, and communicate with your potential service providers.
          Beyond that, a general rule of thumb is to possess at least the basic
          knowledge of the services you’re planning to offer. For instance, if
          you drop service SEO optimization, you should be at least a bit
          knowledgeable on the topic. Otherwise, you won’t know if your
          freelancers have completed quality work for your clients, and you risk
          getting a negative review and losing your reputation. It’s crucial to
          critically assess if the work is good or not and give the right
          directions to freelancers.
